## 1. Introduction
This program is designed to take information from users and analyze it. We created a program 
that extracts and analyzes data provided by customers to show and save information in graphs and csv file for easy understanding.
***
## 2. Install list
Python libraries used by the program include: 

- **etree.ElementTree** : library for implementing simple and efficient APIs for parsing and creating XML data.
- **matplotlib.pyplot** : library for creating a graph using each function of pyplot module. 
- **lmfit** : provides interface to nonlinear optimization and curve fitting problems for Python.
- **glob2** : library for extracting multiple xml files as a list.
- **numpy** : the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- **sklearn** : Python library that you can use to analyze machine learning on Python.
- **statsmodels** : statsmodels provides classes and functions for the estimation of many dirfferent statistical models.
- **dateutil** : The dateutil uses different text formats as date syntax. It is a useful library when dealing with dates by changing them.
- **pandas** : library for primarily using dataframe, and finally to view csv file.
- **os** : allows you to control OS resources such as environmental variables, directories, files, and so on.  
  
**if you want to install all package, enter 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in terminal.**

## 3. Usage
- **first**: Enter the desired Lot, Wafer, Row, Column, Maskset, and Testsite on run.py and run it.
- **Second**: Determine whether to save the graph.
- **Third**: Determine whether to show the graph.
